The first 8-bit register you\nread in C is always 0xFF. To read something you care about (like x-y-z coordinates),\nyou need to read multiple registers in one go with an 8-bit offset, to get an array\nof bytes. Each coordinate is stored as a 16-bit value across two registers - the LSB\nand MSB bits. By default, reading multiple bytes will skip the LSB, so you also need\nto write to other registers so this is turned off!  <br><br>\n\nThe audio was done using the ALSA C API. Pushing the joystick will queue new PCM samples for\nplayback. A thread will load the samples into memory, and another thread will play them back.\nA third (heartbeat) thread will send/receive the current beat over UDP to the node web server\nso it can be displayed and controlled from the frontend!\n", "proj2"=>"<br><br>‚ÄúMorse Driver‚Äù is a misc driver that runs on a custom Linux kernel.  In Linux, hardware\ninteraction is exposed via device driver files. Writing a string to /dev/morse-code will\nflash an onboard LED with the morse code equivalent. Reading will spit out the dot/dash\nequivalent of your strings in text.

The beauty of this is\nthe same single binary can be run by two different people on their own computers.

Unlike malloc, I had tight control over where in memory my bytes were stored.\nI also implemented a UDP networking solution in C that ran on two threads.
