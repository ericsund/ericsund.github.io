The first 8-bit register you\nread in C is always 0xFF. To read something you care about (like x-y-z coordinates),\nyou need to read multiple registers in one go with an 8-bit offset, to get an array\nof bytes. Each coordinate is stored as a 16-bit value across two registers - the LSB\nand MSB bits. By default, reading multiple bytes will skip the LSB, so you also need\nto write to other registers so this is turned off!  <br><br>\n\nThe audio was done using the ALSA C API. Pushing the joystick will queue new PCM samples for\nplayback. A thread will load the samples into memory, and another thread will play them back.\nA third (heartbeat) thread will send/receive the current beat over UDP to the node web server\nso it can be displayed and controlled from the frontend!\n", "proj2"=>"<br><br>â€œMorse Driverâ€ is a misc driver that runs on a custom Linux kernel.  In Linux, hardware\ninteraction is exposed via device driver files. Writing a string to /dev/morse-code will\nflash an onboard LED with the morse code equivalent. Reading will spit out the dot/dash\nequivalent of your strings in text. This is all stored in the kernelâ€™s FIFO queue.\n", "proj3"=>"<br><br>S-talk lets two people instant message each other over the local area network. The beauty of this is\nthe same single binary can be run by two different people on their own computers.  I had a bit of\nmultithreading going on:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Thread for grabbing keyboard input</li>\n<li>Thread for displaying text on the screen</li>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n  <li>This text comes from either typing a message, or receiving one from the other person</li>\n</ol>\n<li>Thread for sending UDP packets</li>\n<li>Thread for receiving UDP packets</li>\n</ul>\n\nThere were some edge cases:\n<ul>\n<li>If you decide to send the whole Bee Movie script as a string, itâ€™s way too long to fit in a single\nUDP packet, so\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>chop it into several partitions</li>\n<li>add those partitions into a free list</li>\n<li>send each paritition as an individual packet until the free list is empty</li>\n</ol>\n<li>When two users try to send at once, or receive at once, we need a mutex and signaler/waiter to handle\nit.

Unlike malloc, I had tight control over where in memory my bytes were stored.\nI also implemented a UDP networking solution in C that ran on two threads. The whole thing worked with one\nsocket - all you had to do was run the compiled binary on two different computers.\n", "proj4"=>"I worked on a Dynamical Systems project which used chaos theory for data encryption and secure communication.\nHere's a <a href=\"https://github.com/ericsund/467-chaos-theory/blob/main/MATH_467_Project.pdf\">link to the paper</a>!\n", "serving"=>false}:ET
