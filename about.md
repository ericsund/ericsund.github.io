Hey there! üëã I'm Eric Sund - a Computer Science and Mathematics major set to graduate this year (2021).

I enjoy app development üíª and lower-level embedded systems, operating systems, etc.  I've also got a knack for numerical methods üî¢ and scientific computing üß™.  In my time at SFU, I tutored first-year CS students üë®‚Äçüè´, and gained experience in several internships.  I also helped run dozens of tech events including [HackerX](https://hackerx.org/).

Apart from math and programming, I'm into camping ‚õ∫, hiking üéí, and listening to indie rock üéµ!

This summer I'm working at [Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/) as DevOps Engineer Intern.  Shoot me an [email](mailto:epsund@gmail.com) if you'd like to chat!
