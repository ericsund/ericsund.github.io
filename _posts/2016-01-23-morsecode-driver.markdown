"Morse Driver" is a misc driver that runs on a custom Linux kernel.

In Linux, hardware interaction is exposed via device driver files.  Writing a string to `/dev/morse-code` will flash an onboard LED with the morse code equivalent.  Reading will spit out the dot/dash equivalent of your strings in text.  This is all stored in the kernel's FIFO queue.

This was a neat project where I got to learn about:

* Building Linux drivers, of course
* Modifying and copmiling a custom Linux kernel
* Booting a device tree and kernel via TFTP with UBoot
* Bit twiddling and masking
